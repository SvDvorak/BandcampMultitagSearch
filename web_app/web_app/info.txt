Bandcamp is a great place to find new and fascinating music.

But you probably have an idea of your type of music so actually finding new things matching that taste is a bit tough.

This tool helps you out by letting you search for different tags/genres/locations and finds albums that match all those criterias.


So just start adding criterias in the text box and when you find an album you find interesting, click on the album to jump to its page.

Note that tags that have not been cached previously might take a while for the server to cache up.


Known Issues:
- It isn't possible to get all albums at Bandcamp so some albums might be missing.
