<h3>Camp Explorer</h3>
Bandcamp is a great place to find new and fascinating music.

But you probably have an idea of your type of music so actually finding new things matching that taste is a bit tough.

This tool helps you out by letting you search for different tags/genres/locations and finds albums that match all those criterias.

<h3>Usage</h3>
Type in a search criteria and press add. Repeat for all tags you want to find albums for. When you find an interesting one, click on the album to jump to its page.

Note that tags that have not been cached previously might take a while for the server to cache up.

<h3>Known Issues</h3>
- It isn't possible to get all albums at Bandcamp so some albums might be missing.

<h3>Release Notes</h3>
2.0.0
- New web-client
- Major changes to how searching works compared to older version of Chrome app, should give a 10x increase in results and return them much faster if they've already been cached.
